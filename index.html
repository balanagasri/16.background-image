        <p> Background Image on an HTML element<br>
            To add a background image on an HTML element, use the HTML style attribute and the CSS background-image property:<br>
            You can also specify the background image in the style> element, in the head> section:<br>
            
            Background Image on a Page<br>
            If you want the entire page to have a background image, you must specify the background image on the body> element:<br>

            Background Repeat<br>
            If the background image is smaller than the element, the image will repeat itself, horizontally and vertically, <br>
            until it reaches the end of the element:<br>
            To avoid the background image from repeating itself, set the background-repeat property to no-repeat.<br>
            
            Background Cover<br>
            If you want the background image to cover the entire element, you can set the background-size property to cover.<br>
            Also, to make sure the entire element is always covered, set the background-attachment property to fixed:<br>
            This way, the background image will cover the entire element, with no stretching (the image will keep its original proportions):<br>
            
            Background Stretch<br>
            If you want the background image to stretch to fit the entire element, you can set the background-size property to 100% 100%:<br>
            Try resizing the browser window, and you will see that the image will stretch, but always cover the entire element<br>
